Ansible roles for RHEL configuration.

## Quick Intro

See the example playbook [configure_rhel.yml](configure_rhel.yml) for
all the configuration options these roles support and how they could be
used together. For additional roles to configure RHEL (such as network
and storage), see https://github.com/linux-system-roles (available as
_rhel-system-roles_ on RHEL).

NB. Recent versions of _rhel-system-roles_ may include similar roles as
are included in this repository. Depending on the use case and support
needs it should be evaluated which one to prefer. If in doubt, use the
supported versions.
