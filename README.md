Ansible roles for RHEL configuration.

## Quick Intro

See the example playbook [configure_rhel.yml](configure_rhel.yml) for
all the configuration options these roles support and how they could be
used together. For additional roles to configure RHEL (such as network
and storage), see https://github.com/linux-system-roles (available as
_rhel-system-roles_ on RHEL.
